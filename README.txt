Thank you for downloading my Email Bot! 

To get started, you can either choose to use the bot_script_outlook.py file or bot_script_google.py files.

If you choose to use the google option. You will need to configure your gmail account with two-step authentication in order
to get your app password. You can then enter your credentials in the .env file within the quotes.

If you choose the outlook option, the only thing you will need to do before running the script is making sure you have a valid
Microsoft account and outlook is downloaded on your machine. You will then need to make sure that you are logged in on your account.

The excel sheet email_list.xlsx, is where you are going to include your emails and names of your recipients to be automatically included
in your emails. 

The email_templates.py file includes the templates of your emails. Currently it randomizes the email using RNG but that can all be modified 
to your preferences. 

The bot can also change the user's display name (Only when using the bot_script_google.py file however). This can be modified within 
the email_templates.py file. 

Please use this email bot responsibly and leave any feedback you may have!

Thank you!!!
